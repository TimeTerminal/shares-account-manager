Position Calculator
Positions represent what assets and how much of them a client currently holds in their investment account.

Here's an example of a client's positions:

ABC-CA stocks: 10 shares 10 shares of the Canadian (CA) stock ABC
DEF-US stocks: 20 shares 20 shares of the American (US) stock DEF
Cash: 100 CAD 100 Canadian dollars

Each asset is represented by its ticker symbol (ABC) and country code (CA).

A client acquires or sells stocks and deposits or withdraws cash through activities.

Each activity tells us how each position will change.
Starting from our position example above, here are some sample activities:

    Buy 5 shares of ABC-CA for the cost of $30 CAD
    This activity adds 5 shares to ABC-CA, bringing the total to 15 shares
    It also reduces the current cash balance by $30, bringing the total to $70
    Sell 3 shares of DEF-US for $50 CAD
    This activity reduces 3 shares from DEF-US, bringing the total to 17 shares
    It also increases the current cash balance by $50, bringing the total to $120
    Deposit $100 CAD
    This activity adds $100 to the current cash balance, bringing the total to $220
    Withdrawal $40 CAD
    This activity reduces $40 from the current cash balance, bringing the total to $180

Our goal with this challenge is to calculate up-to-date positions for our client based on the provided activities.

Given the following input:
Deposit
{
"date": "2015-02-25",
"type": "DEP",
"symbol": null,
"country": null,
"quantity": "0.0",
"net_amount": "200.0"
}
Withdrawal
{
"date": "2015-03-01",
"type": "WDL",
"symbol": null,
"country": null,
"quantity": "0.0",
"net_amount": "-50.0"
}
Buy
{
"date": "2015-02-26",
"type": "BUY",
"symbol": "ABC",
"country": "CA",
"quantity": "3.0",
"net_amount": "-70.0"
},
{
"date": "2015-02-26",
"type": "BUY",
"symbol": "ABC",
"country": "US",
"quantity": "5.0",
"net_amount": "-40.0"
}
SELL
{
"date": "2015-02-27",
"type": "SELL",
"symbol": "ABC",
"country": "CA",
"quantity": "-1.0",
"net_amount": "60.0"
}
We'd expect the following output:
ABC-CA: 2 shares
ABC-US: 5 shares
Cash: \$100
Keep in mind

    The client starts with no positions nor cash.
    The activities might be out-of-order.
